#Task #1

# 1.Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
''''when the values of both the operands are equal. Thus, the condition would become true is == operator
The ‘==’ is known as the equality operator. comparison operator,x=5,y=5,x==y true
The ‘=’ is known as the identity operator.   Assignment operator ,x=5
Assign the value of the right side of the expression to the left side operand '''

# 2.What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

'''the ** operator is used for exponentiation. It raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
   result=2**3
   result=8'''

# 3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used
''' ^ operator is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It performs a bitwise XOR operation between two integers.'''
